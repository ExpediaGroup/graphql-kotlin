/**
 * **`@extends` directive is deprecated**. Federation v2 no longer requires `@extends` directive due to the smart entity type
 * merging. All usage of `@extends` directive should be removed from your Federation v2 schemas.
 *
 * ```graphql
 * directive @extends on OBJECT | INTERFACE
 * ```
 *
 * Extends directive is used to represent type extensions in the schema. Native type extensions are currently unsupported by the graphql-kotlin libraries. Federated extended types should have
 * corresponding @key directive defined that specifies primary key required to fetch the underlying object.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @KeyDirective(FieldSet("id"))
 * @ExtendsDirective
 * class Product(@ExternalDirective val id: String) {
 *   fun newFunctionality(): String = "whatever"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * should generate
 *
 * ```graphql
 * type Product @extends @key(fields : "id") {
 *   id: String! @external
 *   newFunctionality: String!
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see KeyDirective
