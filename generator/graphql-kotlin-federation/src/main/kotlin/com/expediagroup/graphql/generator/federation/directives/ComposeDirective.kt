/**
 * ```graphql
 * directive @composeDirective(name: String!) repeatable on SCHEMA
 * ```
 *
 * By default, Supergraph schema excludes all custom directives. The `@composeDirective` is used to specify custom directives that should be exposed in the Supergraph schema.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given `@custom` directive we can preserve it in the Supergraph schema
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @GraphQLDirective(name = "custom", locations = [Introspection.DirectiveLocation.FIELD_DEFINITION])
 * annotation class CustomDirective
 *
 * @ComposeDirective(name = "custom")
 * @LinkDirective()
 * class CustomSchema
 *
 * class SimpleQuery {
 *   @CustomDirective
 *   fun helloWorld(): String = "Hello World"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * it will generate following schema
 *
 * ```graphql
 * schema @composeDirective(name: "@custom") @link(import : ["@composeDirective", "@extends", "@external", "@inaccessible", "@interfaceObject", "@key", "@override", "@provides", "@requires", "@shareable", "@tag", "FieldSet"], url : "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.5"){
 *    query: Query
 * }
 *
 * directive @custom on FIELD_DEFINITION
 *
 * type Query {
 *   helloWorld: String! @custom
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#composedirective">@composeDirective definition</a>
