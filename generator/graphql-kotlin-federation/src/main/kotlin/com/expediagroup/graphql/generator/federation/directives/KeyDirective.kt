/**
 * ```graphql
 * directive @key(fields: _FieldSet!) repeatable on OBJECT | INTERFACE
 * ```
 *
 * The @key directive is used to indicate a combination of fields that can be used to uniquely identify and fetch an object or interface. Key directive should be specified on the root base type as
 * well as all the corresponding federated (i.e. extended) types. Key fields specified in the directive field set should correspond to a valid field on the underlying GraphQL interface/object.
 * Federated extended types should also instrument all the referenced key fields with @external directive.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @KeyDirective(FieldSet("id"))
 * class Product(val id: String, val name: String)
 * ```
 *
 * should generate
 *
 * ```graphql
 * type Product @key(fields: "id") {
 *   id: String!
 *   name: String!
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param fields field set that represents a set of fields forming the key
 *
 * @see FieldSet
 * @see com.expediagroup.graphql.generator.federation.types.FIELD_SET_SCALAR_TYPE
 * @see ExtendsDirective
 * @see ExternalDirective
