/**
 * ```graphql
 * # federation v1 definition
 * directive @key(fields: _FieldSet!) repeatable on OBJECT | INTERFACE
 *
 * # federation v2 definition
 * directive @key(fields: _FieldSet!, resolvable: Boolean = true) repeatable on OBJECT | INTERFACE
 * ```
 *
 * The @key directive is used to indicate a combination of fields that can be used to uniquely identify and fetch an object or interface. Key directive should be specified on the root entity type as
 * well as all the corresponding federated (i.e. extended) types. Key fields specified in the directive field set should correspond to a valid field on the underlying GraphQL interface/object.
 * Federated extended types should also instrument all the referenced key fields with @external directive.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given following entity type definition
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @KeyDirective(FieldSet("id"))
 * class Product(val id: String, val name: String)
 * ```
 *
 * it will generate following schema
 *
 * ```graphql
 * type Product @key(fields: "id") {
 *   id: String!
 *   name: String!
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Entity types can be referenced from other subgraphs without contributing any additional fields, i.e. we can update type within our schema with a reference to a federated type. In order to generate
 * a valid schema, we need to define **stub** for federated entity that contains only key fields and also mark it as not resolvable within our subgraph. For example, if we have `Review` entity defined
 * in our supergraph, we can reference it in our product schema using following code
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @KeyDirective(fields = FieldSet("id"))
 * class Product(val id: String, val name: String, val reviews: List<Review>)
 *
 * // review stub referencing just the key fields
 * @KeyDirective(fields = FieldSet("id"), resolvable = false)
 * class Review(val id: String)
 * ```
 *
 * which will generate
 *
 * ```graphql
 * type Product @key(fields: "id") {
 *   id: String!
 *   name: String!
 *   reviews: [Review!]!
 * }
 *
 * type Review @key(fields: "id", resolvable: false) {
 *   id: String!
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This allows end users to query GraphQL Gateway for any product review fields and they will be resolved by calling the appropriate subgraph.
 *
 * @param fields field set that represents a set of fields forming the key
 * @param resolvable boolean flag indicating whether this entity can be resolved within this subgraph, only available in Federation v2
 *
 * @see FieldSet
 * @see ExternalDirective
