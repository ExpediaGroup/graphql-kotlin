/**
 * ```graphql
 * directive @requires(fields: _FieldSet!) on FIELD_DEFINITON
 * ```
 *
 * The `@requires` directive is used to specify external (provided by other subgraphs) entity fields that are needed to resolve target field. It is used to develop a query plan where
 * the required fields may not be needed by the client, but the service may need additional information from other subgraphs. Required fields specified in the directive field set should
 * correspond to a valid field on the underlying GraphQL interface/object and should be instrumented with `@external` directive.
 *
 * Fields specified in the `@requires` directive will only be specified in the queries that reference those fields. This is problematic for Kotlin as the non-nullable primitive properties
 * have to be initialized when they are declared. Simplest workaround for this problem is to initialize the underlying property to some default value (e.g. null) that will be used if
 * it is not specified. This approach might become problematic though as it might be impossible to determine whether fields was initialized with the default value or the invalid/default
 * value was provided by the federated query. Another potential workaround is to rely on delegation to initialize the property after the object gets created. This will ensure that exception
 * will be thrown if queries attempt to resolve fields that reference the uninitialized property.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @KeyDirective(FieldSet("id"))
 * @ExtendsDirective
 * class Product(@ExternalDirective val id: String) {
 *
 *   @ExternalDirective
 *   var weight: Double by Delegates.notNull()
 *
 *   @RequiresDirective(FieldSet("weight"))
 *   fun shippingCost(): String { ... }
 *
 *   fun additionalInfo(): String { ... }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * should generate
 *
 * ```graphql
 * type Product @extends @key(fields : "id") {
 *   additionalInfo: String!
 *   id: String! @external
 *   shippingCost: String! @requires(fields : "weight")
 *   weight: Float! @external
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param fields field set that represents a set of additional external fields required to resolve target field
 *
 * @see FieldSet
 * @see ExternalDirective
