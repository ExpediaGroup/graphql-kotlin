## Ktor HTTP Client Customization

`GraphQLKtorClient` is a thin wrapper on top of [Ktor HTTP Client](https://ktor.io/docs/client.html) and supports fully
asynchronous non-blocking communication. It is highly customizable and can be configured with any supported Ktor HTTP
[engine](https://ktor.io/clients/http-client/engines.html) and [features](https://ktor.io/clients/http-client/features.html).

See [Ktor HTTP Client documentation](https://ktor.io/clients/index.html) for additional details.

### Global Client Customization

A single instance of `GraphQLKtorClient` can be used to handle many GraphQL operations. You can specify a custom instance
of Ktor `HttpClient` and a target `GraphQLClientSerializer`.

The below example configures a new `GraphQLKtorClient` to use the `OkHttp` engine with custom timeouts, adds a default `X-MY-API-KEY`
header to all requests, and enables basic logging of the requests.

```kotlin
val okHttpClient = HttpClient(engineFactory = OkHttp) {
    engine {
        config {
            connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            readTimeout(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            writeTimeout(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        }
    }
    defaultRequest {
        header("X-MY-API-KEY", "someSecretApiKey")
    }
    install(Logging) {
        logger = Logger.DEFAULT
        level = LogLevel.INFO
    }
}
val client = GraphQLKtorClient(
    url = URL("http://localhost:8080/graphql"),
    httpClient = okHttpClient
)
```

### Per Request Customization

Individual GraphQL requests can be customized through [HttpRequestBuilder](https://ktor.io/docs/request.html#customizing-requests).
You can use this mechanism to specify custom headers, update target url to include custom query parameters, configure
attributes that can be accessed from the pipeline features as well specify timeouts per request.

```kotlin
val helloWorldQuery = HelloWorldQuery(variables = HelloWorldQuery.Variables(name = "John Doe"))
val result = client.execute(helloWorldQuery) {
    header("X-B3-TraceId", "0123456789abcdef")
}
```

## Spring WebClient Customization

`GraphQLWebClient` is a thin wrapper on top of [Spring WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html)
that relies on Reactor Netty for fully asynchronous non-blocking communications. If you want to use Jetty instead you will
need to exclude provided `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty` dependency and instead add `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-reactive-httpclient`
dependency.

### Global Client Customization

A single instance of `GraphQLWebClient` can be used to handle many GraphQL operations and you can customize it by providing
a custom instance of `WebClient.Builder`. See [Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-webclient-customization)
for additional details.

Example below configures `GraphQLWebClient` with custom timeouts and adds a default `X-MY-API-KEY` header to all requests.

```kotlin
val httpClient: HttpClient = HttpClient.create()
    .option(ChannelOption.CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, 10_000)
    .responseTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(10_000))
val connector: ClientHttpConnector = ReactorClientHttpConnector(httpClient.wiretap(true))
val webClientBuilder = WebClient.builder()
    .clientConnector(connector)
    .defaultHeader("X-MY-API-KEY", "someSecretApiKey")

val client = GraphQLWebClient(
    url = "http://localhost:8080/graphql",
    builder = webClientBuilder
)
```

### Per Request Customization

Individual GraphQL requests can be customized by providing `WebClient.RequestBodyUriSpec` lambda. You can use this mechanism
to specify custom headers or include custom attributes or query parameters.

```kotlin
val helloWorldQuery = HelloWorldQuery(variables = HelloWorldQuery.Variables(name = "John Doe"))
val result = client.execute(helloWorldQuery) {
    header("X-B3-TraceId", "0123456789abcdef")
}
```

## Custom GraphQL Client

GraphQL Kotlin libraries provide generic a `GraphQLClient` interface as well as Ktor HTTP Client and Spring WebClient based
reference implementations. Both `GraphQLKtorClient` and `GraphQLWebClient` are open classes which means you can also
extend them to provide some custom `execute` logic.

```kotlin
class CustomGraphQLClient(url: URL) : GraphQLKtorClient(url = url) {

    override suspend fun <T: Any> execute(request: GraphQLClientRequest<T>, requestCustomizer: HttpRequestBuilder.() -> Unit): GraphQLClientResponse<T> {
        // custom init logic
        val result = super.execute(request, requestCustomizer)
        // custom finalize logic
        return result
    }
}
```

## Deprecated Field Usage

Build plugins will automatically fail generation of a client if any of the specified query files are referencing
deprecated fields. This ensures that your clients have to explicitly opt-in into deprecated usage by specifying
`allowDeprecatedFields` configuration option.
