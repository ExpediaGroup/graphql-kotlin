title: Ktor Plugin Configuration
---

`graphql-kotlin-ktor-server` plugin can be configured by using DSL when installing the plugin. Configuration is broken into multiple
groups related to specific functionality. See sections below for details.

```kotlin
install(GraphQL) {
    schema {
        // configuration that controls schema generation logic
    }
    engine {
        // configurations that control GraphQL execution engine
    }
    server {
        // configurations that control GraphQL HTTP server
    }
}
```

## Configuration Files

Ktor supports specifying configurations in `application.conf` (HOCON) or `application.yaml` file. By default, only HOCON format
is supported. To use a YAML configuration file, you need to add the `ktor-server-config-yaml` dependency to your project dependencies.
See [Ktor documentation](https://ktor.io/docs/configuration-file.html) for details.

:::caution
Not all configuration properties can be specified in your configuration file. You will need to use DSL to configure more advanced features
that cannot be represented in the property file syntax (e.g. any instantiated objects).
:::

All configuration options in `application.conf` format, with their default values are provided below.

```kotlin
graphql {
    schema {
        // this is a required property that you need to set to appropriate value
        // example value is just provided for illustration purposes
        packages = [
            "com.example"
        ]
        federation {
            enabled = false
            tracing {
                enabled = true
                debug = false
            }
        }
    }
    engine {
        automaticPersistedQueries {
            enabled = false
        }
        batching {
            enabled = false
            strategy = LEVEL_DISPATCHED
        }
        introspection {
            enabled = true
        }
    }
}
```

## Schema Configuration

This section configures `graphql-kotlin-schema-generation` logic and is the **only** section that has to be configured.
At a minimum you need to configure the list of packages that can contain your GraphQL schema definitions and a list of queries.

All configuration options, with their default values are provided below.

```kotlin
schema {
    // this is a required property that you need to set to appropriate value
    // example value is just provided for illustration purposes
    packages = listOf("com.example")
    // non-federated schemas, require at least a single query
    queries = listOf()
    mutations = listOf()
    subscriptions = listOf()
    schemaObject = null
    // federated schemas require federated hooks
    hooks = NoopSchemaGeneratorHooks
    topLevelNames = TopLevelNames()
    federation {
        enabled = false
        tracing {
            enabled = true
            debug = false
        }
    }
    // required for GraalVM native servers
    typeHierarchy = null
}
```

## GraphQL Execution Engine Configuration

This section configures `graphql-java` execution engine that will be used to process your GraphQL requests.

All configuration options, with their default values are provided below.

```kotlin
engine {
    automaticPersistedQueries {
        enabled = false
    }
    // DO NOT enable default batching logic if specifying custom provider
    batching {
        enabled = false
        strategy = SYNC_EXHAUSTION
    }
    introspection {
        enabled = true
    }
    dataFetcherFactoryProvider = SimpleKotlinDataFetcherFactoryProvider()
    dataLoaderRegistryFactory = KotlinDataLoaderRegistryFactory()
    exceptionHandler = SimpleDataFetcherExceptionHandler()
    executionIdProvider = null
    idValueUnboxer = IDValueUnboxer()
    instrumentations = emptyList()
    // DO NOT specify custom provider if enabling default batching logic
    preparsedDocumentProvider = null
}
```

## Server Configuration

This section configures your GraphQL HTTP server.

All configuration options, with their default values are provided below.

```kotlin
server {
    contextFactory = DefaultKtorGraphQLContextFactory()
    jacksonConfiguration = { }
    requestParser = KtorGraphQLRequestParser(jacksonObjectMapper().apply(jacksonConfiguration))
}
```

## Routes Configuration

GraphQL Kotlin Ktor Plugin DOES NOT automatically configure any routes. You need to explicitly configure `Routing`
plugin with GraphQL routes. This allows you to selectively enable routes and wrap them in some additional logic (e.g. `Authentication`).

GraphQL Kotlin Ktor Plugin provides following `Route` extensions that can be called when configuring `Routing` plugin.

### GraphQL POST route

This is the main route for processing your GraphQL requests. By default, it will use `/graphql` endpoint and respond
using chunked encoding.

```kotlin
fun Route.graphQLPostRoute(endpoint: String = "graphql", streamingResponse: Boolean = true, jacksonConfiguration: ObjectMapper.() -> Unit = {}): Route
```

### GraphQL GET route

:::caution
Only `Query` operations are supported by the GET route.
:::

GraphQL route for processing GET requests. By default, it will use `/graphql` endpoint and respond using chunked encoding.

```kotlin
fun Route.graphQLGetRoute(endpoint: String = "graphql", streamingResponse: Boolean = true, jacksonConfiguration: ObjectMapper.() -> Unit = {}): Route
```

### GraphQL Subscriptions route

GraphQL route for processing subscriptions. By default, it will use `/subscriptions` endpoint and handle
requests using [graphql-transport-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol handler.

```kotlin
fun Route.graphQLSubscriptionsRoute(
    endpoint: String = "subscriptions",
    protocol: String? = null,
    handlerOverride: KtorGraphQLSubscriptionHandler? = null,
)
```

See related [Subscriptions](./ktor-subscriptions.md) document for more info.

### GraphQL SDL route

Convenience route to expose endpoint that returns your GraphQL schema in SDL format.

```kotlin
fun Route.graphQLSDLRoute(endpoint: String = "sdl"): Route
```

### GraphiQL IDE route

[GraphiQL IDE](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is a convenient tool that helps you to easily interact
with your GraphQL server.

```kotlin
fun Route.graphiQLRoute(endpoint: String = "graphiql", graphQLEndpoint: String = "graphql"): Route
```
