`graphql-kotlin-ktor-client` provides Ktor HTTP client based reference implementation of `GraphQLClient`. `GraphQLKtorClient`
is a thin wrapper on top of [Ktor HTTP Client](https://ktor.io/clients/index.html) and supports fully asynchronous non-blocking
communication. It is highly customizable and can be configured with any supported Ktor HTTP [engine](https://ktor.io/clients/http-client/engines.html)
and [features](https://ktor.io/clients/http-client/features.html).

`GraphQLKtorClient` uses the Ktor HTTP Client to execute the underlying queries. Clients can be customized to use different
GraphQL serializers, different engines (defaults to Coroutine-based IO) and HTTP client features. Custom configurations
can be applied through Ktor DSL style builders.

See [Ktor HTTP Client documentation](https://ktor.io/clients/index.html) for additional details.

## Install it

Using a JVM dependency manager, link `graphql-kotlin-ktor-client` to your project.

With Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.expediagroup</groupId>
  <artifactId>graphql-kotlin-ktor-client</artifactId>
  <version>${latestVersion}</version>
</dependency>
```

With Gradle (example using kts):

```kotlin
implementation("com.expediagroup:graphql-kotlin-ktor-client:$latestVersion")
```

## Use it

### Download Schema

Before we can auto-generate the data model for our GraphQL queries we first need to obtain a copy of a corresponding
GraphQL schema. Do this by running one of the tasks supplied by the GraphQL Kotlin Gradle plugin through your
CLI:

```bash
./gradlew graphqlIntrospectSchema --endpoint="http://localhost:8080/graphql"
```

This runs an introspection query against the target GraphQL server and saves the resulting schema in the `schema.graphql` file
under the build directory. GraphQL schemas can change over time, so you should configure this task to run as part of your
build/release process.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
import com.expediagroup.graphql.plugin.gradle.tasks.GraphQLIntrospectSchemaTask

val graphqlIntrospectSchema by tasks.getting(GraphQLIntrospectSchemaTask::class) {
    endpoint.set("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
}
```

### Write Queries

When creating your GraphQL queries make sure to always specify an operation name, and name the files accordingly. Each one
of your query files will result in a generation of a corresponding Kotlin file with a class matching your operation name.
Generated top level class will contain all your data classes. For example, given `MyAwesomeGraphQLQuery.graphql` with
`myAwesomeQuery` as the operation name, GraphQL Kotlin plugins will generate a corresponding `MyAwesomeGraphQLQuery.kt`
file with a `MyAwesomeQuery` class under the configured package.

Refer to our [documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/client/client-overview) for additional
details and considerations while writing your GraphQL queries.

### Generate Client

GraphQL Kotlin build plugins will auto-generate your data classes based on your queries and the underlying GraphQL schema.
In order to generate your client you will need to specify the target package name, schema file, and queries. If the queries
parameter is omitted, it will default to using `*.graphql` files under your resources directory.

`graphql-kotlin-ktor-client` defaults to use `kotlinx.serialization` whereas the build plugins default to use `Jackson`.
In order to generate `kotlinx.serialization` specific data models you have to explicitly configure build plugins to use
`kotlinx.serialization` serializer. See our [documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/client/client-serialization)
for information on how to customize this behavior.

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("plugin.serialization") version $kotlinVersion
}

val graphqlGenerateClient by tasks.getting(GraphQLGenerateClientTask::class) {
    // we need to overwrite default behavior of using Jackson data model
    serializer.set(GraphQLSerializer.KOTLINX)
    packageName.set("com.expediagroup.graphql.generated")
    // use schema file generated by the introspection task
    schemaFile.set(graphqlIntrospectSchema.outputFile)
    // make sure to run client generation after introspection task
    dependsOn("graphqlIntrospectSchema")
}
```

Additional information about Gradle and Maven plugins as well as their respective tasks/mojos can be found in our
[documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/plugins/gradle-plugin).

### Execute Queries

Your auto generated classes are simple POJOs that optionally accept variables (only if underlying operation uses variables)
as a constructor parameter. `GraphQLClient` exposes generic methods that allow you to execute either a single or batch
request.

`GraphQLKtorClient` uses the Ktor HTTP client to execute the underlying queries and allows you to provide custom `HttpClient`
instance (defaults to CIO engine). Please refer to [Ktor HTTP client documentation](https://ktor.io/clients/index.html)
for additional details.

```kotlin
val client = GraphQLKtorClient(url = URL("http://localhost:8080/graphql"))
val query = MyAwesomeQuery()
val result = client.execute(query)
```

The result of your query is a type safe object that corresponds to your GraphQL query.

Additional information about Gradle and Maven plugins as well as their respective tasks/mojos can be found in our
[documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/plugins/gradle-plugin).
