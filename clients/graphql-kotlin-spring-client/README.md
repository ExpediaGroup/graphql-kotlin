`graphql-kotlin-spring-client` provides Spring WebClient based reference implementation of `GraphQLClient`. `GraphQLWebClient`
is a thin wrapper on top of [Spring WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html)
that relies on Reactor Netty for fully asynchronous non-blocking communications.

`GraphQLWebClient` uses the Spring WebClient to execute the underlying queries. Clients can be customized to use different
GraphQL serializers and by providing customized instance of Spring `WebClient.Builder`.

See [Spring WebClient documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/io.html#io.rest-client.webclient)
for additional details.

## Install it

Using a JVM dependency manager, link `graphql-kotlin-spring-client` to your project.

With Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.expediagroup</groupId>
  <artifactId>graphql-kotlin-spring-client</artifactId>
  <version>${latestVersion}</version>
</dependency>
```

With Gradle (example using kts):

```kotlin
implementation("com.expediagroup:graphql-kotlin-spring-client:$latestVersion")
```

## Use it

### Download Schema

Before we can auto-generate the data model for our GraphQL queries we first need to obtain a copy of a corresponding
GraphQL schema. Do this by running one of the tasks supplied by the GraphQL Kotlin Gradle plugin through your
CLI:

```bash
./gradlew graphqlIntrospectSchema --endpoint="http://localhost:8080/graphql"
```

This runs an introspection query against the target GraphQL server and saves the resulting schema in the `schema.graphql` file
under the build directory. GraphQL schemas can change over time, so you should configure this task to run as part of your
build/release process.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
import com.expediagroup.graphql.plugin.gradle.tasks.GraphQLIntrospectSchemaTask

val graphqlIntrospectSchema by tasks.getting(GraphQLIntrospectSchemaTask::class) {
    endpoint.set("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
}
```

### Write Queries

When creating your GraphQL queries make sure to always specify an operation name, and name the files accordingly. Each one
of your query files will result in a generation of a corresponding Kotlin file with a class matching your operation name.
Generated top level class will contain all your data classes. For example, given `MyAwesomeGraphQLQuery.graphql` with
`myAwesomeQuery` as the operation name, GraphQL Kotlin plugins will generate a corresponding `MyAwesomeGraphQLQuery.kt`
file with a `MyAwesomeQuery` class under the configured package.

Refer to our [documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/client/client-overview) for additional
details and considerations while writing your GraphQL queries.

### Generate Client

GraphQL Kotlin build plugins will auto-generate your data classes based on your queries and the underlying GraphQL schema.
In order to generate your client you will need to specify the target package name, schema file, and queries. If the queries
parameter is omitted, it will default to using `*.graphql` files under your resources directory. In order to generate Spring
WebClient based client implementation you also need to specify client type.

`graphql-kotlin-spring-client` defaults to use `Jackson` which is also the default serializer used by the build plugins.
See our [documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/client/client-serialization) for information
on how to customize this behavior.

```kotlin
val graphqlGenerateClient by tasks.getting(GraphQLGenerateClientTask::class) {
    packageName.set("com.expediagroup.graphql.generated")
    // use schema file generated by the introspection task
    schemaFile.set(graphqlIntrospectSchema.outputFile)
    // make sure to run client generation after introspection task
    dependsOn("graphqlIntrospectSchema")
}
```

Additional information about Gradle and Maven plugins as well as their respective tasks/mojos can be found in our
[documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/plugins/gradle-plugin).

### Execute Queries

Your auto generated classes are simple POJOs that optionally accept variables (only if underlying operation uses variables)
as a constructor parameter. `GraphQLClient` exposes generic methods that allow you to execute either a single or batch
request.

`GraphQLWebClient` is a thin wrapper on top of [Spring WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html)
and can be customized by providing customized instance of Spring `WebClient.Builder`.

```kotlin
val client = GraphQLWebClient(url = "http://localhost:8080/graphql")
val query = MyAwesomeQuery()
val result = client.execute(query)
```

The result of your query is a type safe object that corresponds to your GraphQL query.

[documentation](https://expediagroup.github.io/graphql-kotlin/docs/plugins/gradle-plugin).
