/**
 * Hold and calculate the state of a given [ExecutionInput] by holding and tracking information of all Execution Strategies that
 * were executed to resolve the [ExecutionInput].
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * given this [ExecutionInput]
 *
 * ```
 * query getAstronaut {
 *   astronaut(id: 1) {
 *      id
 *      name
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When the [ExecutionBatchState] will be considered exhausted will have this state:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "/": {
 *     "dispatchedFetches": 1,
 *       "fieldsState": {
 *         "astronaut": {
 *           "fetchState": "DISPATCHED",
 *           "fetchType": "ASYNC",
 *           "result": null,
 *           "executionStrategyPaths": []
 *         }
 *      }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * once astronaut [DataFetcher] completes his value starting a new ExecutionStrategy for `astronaut` field for
 * the resolution of `id`, and `name`, once these fields are dispatched and completed
 * and exhaustion will be calculated again and the state of [ExecutionBatchState] will be the following:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "/": {
 *     "dispatchedFetches": 1,
 *       "fieldsState": {
 *         "astronaut": {
